The Thorax is supposedly going from 920 -> 960 MW of powergrid... however, it doesn't have 920 currently! it has **8**20 MW of powergrid currently. is it going from **8**20 -> **8**60? or a huge boost up from **8**20 -> **9**60?? please clarify! 😄",Items,0.7,Developer,0.7,Developer,0.95,1

1.38E+18,I find AI a great learning tool and good for pretty boilerplate stuff (i.e. apply classes to these elements when loading is true). The learning side though is what I really appreciate - taking what it suggests and dissecting how it works and challenging why it gave that solution. I've been using a combination of ChatGPT and Claude to experiment with building my own NAT Gateway in Rust for example.
